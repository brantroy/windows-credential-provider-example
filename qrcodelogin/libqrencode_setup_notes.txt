# Using libqrencode with Windows Credential Provider

## For Windows Development Environment:

1. Install libqrencode for Windows:
   - Download from: https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/
   - Or use vcpkg: `vcpkg install qrencode`

2. Update the project file (qrcodelogin.vcxproj) to include:
   - Include directories: Path to qrencode headers
   - Library dependencies: qrencode.lib
   - Library directories: Path to qrencode library files

3. The current source code changes:
   - Added #include <qrencode.h> to csamplecredential.cpp
   - Modified _GenerateQRCodeBitmap() to use libqrencode for generating actual QR codes
   - Converts wide string URL to UTF-8 for QR code generation
   - Scales the QR code for better visibility
   - Maintains the URL text display below the QR code

## Linux Cross-Compilation Notes:
This project was modified on Linux with libqrencode installed via apt-get.
For actual Windows deployment, you'll need the Windows version of libqrencode.

## Key Changes Made:
- Replaced simple pattern with actual QR code generation using libqrencode
- Added proper memory management for generated QR codes
- Maintained the same interface for the credential provider system
